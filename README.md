Name of the game
+ HANG URL

Rules
 + Hang Url is word guessing game for one player. Computer will generate words from coding terminology such as function, array etc. And the player will try to guess it by suggesting letters, within a certain number of guesses.
        + Url (aka Earl) will be a coder guy.
 + If the player makes enough incorrect guesses to allow the hangman diagram to be finished, the game is over. 
 + If the player guesses the word before the diagram if finished, the player wins. 


Foreseen challenges or obstacles

+ Follow the style guideline for writing code. 
+ Drawing each step of the diagram and make sure they are correctly placed on the page.
+ Make sure the order of hanging man is correct. 
+ Once the player picks a letter, if the letter is correct make it appear on the word that the player is guessing and at the same time remove it from the letter options below!!!!!!
        + I may just remove the whole alphabet from the page and have the people chose the letters just from their keyboards. This will depend on how far I can get on my project. 
+ If the first game is done and the player clicks on play another game, make sure to take out the already played word from the array.
